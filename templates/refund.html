        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cancellations:</strong> Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within <strong>5 days</strong> of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have already been communicated to sellers/merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping, or the product is out for delivery. In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Perishable Items:</strong> elbencs does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, a refund or replacement can be made if the user establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Damaged or Defective Items:</strong> In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report to our customer service team.

This should be reported within <strong>5 days</strong> of receipt of products.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Product Not as Expected:</strong> If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within <strong>5 days</strong> of receiving the product.
